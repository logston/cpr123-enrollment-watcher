==========================

An update to CPR123 Enrollment Watcher.

This is the second version of a program I made to watch the trends of enrollment in my CPR classes. This new version includes code to track the zip, email host, test results, and first six digits of the phone number of each student enrolled in a class.

Further work on this project was suspended around April 21 do to a request made by an Enrollware associate to discontinue any screen scraping.
